## Task 1: Dependency vulnerability scan

### Summary
Ran `pnpm audit` on entire workspace (root lockfile; all apps included). Filtered findings to apps/web scope only. Found 1 Critical and 1 High severity advisory requiring review.

### Command run
```bash
pnpm audit
```

### Findings

#### Finding 1.1 — Critical

**Package:** vitest  
**Current version:** 2.1.9 (via package.json constraint `^2.1.4`)  
**Vulnerable versions:** <3.2.6  
**Patched versions:** >=3.2.6  
**Dependency type:** Direct (devDependencies)  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:** When Vitest UI server is listening, arbitrary file can be read and executed

**Advisory link:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp

**Status:** Flagged — needs product decision  
**Recommended target version:** >=3.2.6 (or higher semver-compatible)

---

#### Finding 1.2 — High

**Package:** vite  
**Current version:** 5.4.21 (transitive via vitest → vite)  
**Vulnerable versions:** <=6.4.2  
**Patched versions:** >=6.4.3  
**Dependency type:** Transitive (vitest > vite; direct vite@^8.1.1 in devDependencies is not vulnerable)  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** `server.fs.deny` bypass on Windows alternate paths

**Advisory link:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff

**Status:** Flagged — needs product decision  
**Recommended target version:** >=6.4.3 (or upgrade vitest to pull in non-vulnerable vite)

---

### Notes

- The direct vite@^8.1.1 in apps/web devDependencies is not vulnerable; the High finding refers to vite@5.4.21 which is pulled in transitively by vitest's internal dependencies.
- Audit exit code: 1 (expected when vulnerabilities are found).
- Total advisories found across all workspaces: 8 (1 Critical, 1 High, 6 Moderate). Only Critical and High listed per task requirements.
